# DndTv

DND-TV is intended to be a PNP desktop application for Dungeons and Dragons players who are looking for simple tools to make their sessions go more smoothly.  Track initiative, get live NPC descriptions, and more.

# Dev

If you're looking to help out, you can get hot reloading by running these both of these commands at the same time from the root of the application:

`electron .`
`ng s`

Feel free to put up a pull request if you're interested!  There's plenty of work to do.
