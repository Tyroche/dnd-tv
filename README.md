# DndTv

DND-TV is intended to be a PNP desktop application for Dungeons and Dragons players who are looking for simple tools to make their sessions go more smoothly.  Track initiative, get live NPC descriptions, and more.

# Roadmap (In Progress)

- Initiative Table
- Bootcamp Embedding
- Youtube Embedding
- Sound website (?) Embedding (sliders)
- Google image search for reference
- Dynamic NPC generation (ML?)
- Quick spell lookup
- Status lookup
- Monster image lookup

# Dev

If you're looking to help out, you'll need to pull down the repository and install a few tools:

- `npm install -g @angular/cli electron`

If you're looking to help out, you can get hot reloading by installing this tool:

- `npm install -g electron-reload`

Then running both of these commands at the same time:

- `electron .`
- `ng s`


Feel free to put up a pull request if you're interested!  There's plenty of work to do.
